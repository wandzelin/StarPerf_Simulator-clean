Function : This script is used to simulate the constellation working in +Grid mode

Input : Satellite constellation without any ISL (i.e. each satellite is a node and there are no edges between nodes)

Output : A satellite constellation that has been connected according to the +Grid mode (that is, each satellite has 4
         ISLs to establish connections with two satellites in the same orbit and two satellites in adjacent orbits)


After the file is executed, ISLs have been established between the satellites in each shell in the incoming
constellation, and the delay time matrix between each satellite has also been written to the data/ folder.
