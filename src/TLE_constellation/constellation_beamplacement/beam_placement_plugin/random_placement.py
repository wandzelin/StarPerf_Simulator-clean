Function : This script implements the random beam placement algorithm

           Specifically: each satellite is equipped with n antennas, each antenna can emit a spot beam,
           and then the earth's surface is divided into several cells according to a certain resolution
           using the h3 library. Each spot beam can cover one cell. Then calculate the set of all cells
           visible to each satellite, and then find the cells that are not covered by the beam in the set.
           The satellite randomly selects a cell from these uncovered cells to allocate the beam, indicating
           that the cell is covered by the satellite. If all n antennas of the satellite have been used up,
           or all cells within the visible range of the satellite have been covered, no more beams will be
           allocated to the ground.

           Set the above process to be repeated every dT seconds, so that the simulated constellation occurs
           beam scheduling every dT seconds. For example, when dT=15, it can be used to indicate that Starlink
           beam scheduling occurs every 15 seconds, etc.

# Function: given a point on land (user, POP or GS, etc.) and the coordinates of a satellite in the three-dimensional
#           Cartesian system, determine whether the point on land can see the satellite.
# Parameters:
# sat_x, sat_y, sat_z : the xyz coordinates of the satellite in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system
# point_x, point_y, point_z : the xyz coordinates of points on land in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system
# minimum_elevation : the minimum elevation angle at which a point on land can see the satellite
# Return value : True means it can be seen, False means it can't be seen
# Implementation idea: Calculate the vector from the ground point to the satellite and the vector from the ground point
#                to the center of the earth respectively, and then calculate the angle between the two vectors. If the
#                angle is greater than or equal to (90Â°+minimum_elevation), it means it is visible, otherwise it means
#                it is invisible.

# sh : sh is a shell class object, representing a layer of shell in the constellation
# h3_resolution : the resolution of cells divided by h3 library. The currently supported resolutions are: 0/1/2/3/4
